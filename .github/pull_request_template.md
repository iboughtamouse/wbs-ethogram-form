## ⚠️ Base Branch - READ FIRST

**Before creating this PR, verify you're targeting the correct base branch:**

- [ ] ✅ This PR targets `staging` (feature/fix/refactor/test/chore branches)
- [ ] ✅ This PR targets `main` (ONLY for `staging` → `main` releases or `docs/` branches)

**Why this matters:** Our workflow requires all changes to go through `staging` for integration testing before reaching `main` (production).

**Wrong base?** Edit the base branch dropdown above ⬆️ before clicking "Create pull request"

> 📚 See [Branching Strategy](../BRANCHING.md) for complete workflow guide.
